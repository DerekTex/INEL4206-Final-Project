Project Description:
* The aim of this project is to develop an array of temperature censors 
connected to an ESP32 processor. These censors will be scattered across
the campus so we can collect and store temperature data. The data collected 
will be available for examination through a website; in there the user
will be able to see the current temperature as well as it's history from 
the first measure recorded.
