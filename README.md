## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project aims to develop an array of sensors that works with an ESP32
micro controller. These sensors will be placed in different rooms across 
the campus to gather data and store it in the cloud server. The data collected 
will be available for examination through a website (http://esp32proj.space:1880/ui); 
the user will have access to various tabs that display information about a specific 
room whether it's temperature or capacity related. There will also be a tab with 
a graph display containing the temperature history from the first recorded measure.

## MAIN COMPONENTS:
